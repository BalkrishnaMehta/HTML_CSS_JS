		<p>What is HTML?
			<ul>

    			<li>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</li>
    			<li>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</li>
    			<li>HTML consists of a series of elements</li>

			<h3>HTML Documents</h3>
			All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: &lt;!DOCTYPE html &gt;.<br>
			The HTML document itself begins with &lt;html&gt; and ends with &lt;/html &gt;.<br>
			The visible part of the HTML document is between &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body &gt;.<br><br><br>

			<h3>HTML Headings</h3>
			HTML headings are defined with the &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; tags.<br>
			&lt;h1&gt; defines the most important heading. &lt;h6&gt; defines the least important heading: </br><br><br>

			<h3>HTML Paragraphs</h3>
			HTML paragraphs are defined with the &lt;p&gt; tag:<br><br><br>

			<h3>HTML Links</h3>
			HTML links are defined with the &lt;a&gt; tag:
			<h4>Example</h4>
			&lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com"&gt;This is a link&lt;/a&gt;<br><br>
			The link's destination is specified in the href attribute.<br> 
			Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.<br>
			You will learn more about attributes in a later chapter.<br><br><br>

		<h2 id="c3">HTML Elements</h2>
		<p>
		An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.<br>
		HTML Elements<br>
		The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:<br>
		&lt;tagname&gt;Content goes here...&lt;/tagname&gt;<br>

		Examples of some HTML elements:<br>
		&lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
		&lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.<&glt;/p&gt;<br>
		&lt;/body&gt;<br>
		&lt;/html&gt;<br>
		<h3>Empty HTML Elements</h3>
		HTML elements with no content are called empty elements.
		The <br> tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:
		HTML is Not Case Sensitive
		HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
		The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags, but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter 			document types like XHTML.
		<h3>HTML Tag Reference</h3>
		W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about these tags and their attributes.
		</p>

		<h2 id="c4">HTML Attributes</h2>
		<p>
		<ul>
    		<li>All HTML elements can have attributes.<li>
    		<li>Attributes provide additional information about elements.</li>
    		<li>Attributes are always specified in the start tag.</li>
    		<li>Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>The href Attribute</h3>
		The &lt;a&gt; tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:
		<h3> The src Attribute </h3>
		The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be 			displayed:
		There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
		<ol>
		<li>Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. 
		Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

		Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright 			laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.</li>

		<li> Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If 			the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a 			slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".
		Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.
		The width and height Attributes</li>
		</ol>
		The &lt;img&gt; tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specifies the width and height of the image 
		(in pixels):
		<h3>The alt Attribute</h3>
		The required alt attribute for the &lt;img&gt; tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason 			cannot be displayed. This can be due to slow connection, or an error in the src attribute
		, or if the user uses a screen reader.
		<h3>The style Attribute</h3>
		The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
		Example 
		&lt;p style="color:red;"&gt;This is a red paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
		You will learn more about styles in our HTML Styles chapter.
		<h3>The lang Attribute</h3>
		You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to 			assist search engines and browsers.
		The following example specifies English as the language:
