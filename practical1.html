		<h1>Introduction To HTML</h1>
		<p>
		Q. Why we learn HTML?<br>soln:- As technology grows, so too does its use within business. To see how vital HTML and technology is 		to business, take your smartphone out of your pocket. How many apps do you have? How often do you use the browsers? Do you use it 		for shopping or to use purchases? Does it control things, like the temperature of your home? Do you use it to book hotels, 		flights, haircuts, or anything else? Do you use it to order food or to listen to or watch something online? To a certain degree, 			do you depend on it?<br><br> 
		Right now, there are hundreds of thousands of roles throughout Europe that require, at the very least, HTML skills. In fact, the 			world is going through a severe skills gap, and as a result, salaries are always growing for software developers. Employers 		recognise these gaps, and according to numerous sources, they are losing vast amounts of potential revenues as a result.<br><br>
		Whatever your internet usage, most of what you digest and use goes back to business and various industries. Here’s the thing, code 		is not just about buying and selling things. It’s also there to improve services. Look at healthcare and how technologies are 			changing that. Look at manufacturing, architecture and more. Because of technology and code, all of these industries have been 			brought willingly into the 21st century.<br>

		Q. What is HTTP?<br>soln:- HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is used to send and recieve content from server to client.

		Q. Basic HTML tags and Elements.<br>soln:- HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display 		the content. With the help of tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain 		three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags. An HTML element is defined by a 			start tag, some content, and an end tag.
		<br>Basic HTML tags:
		<ul>
			<li>!DOCTYPE HTML  which declare Document uses HTML5</li>
			<li>The &lt;html&gt; element is the root element of an HTML page</li>
			<li>The &lt;head&gt; element contains meta information about the HTML page</li>
			<li>The &lt;title&gt; element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the 				page's tab)</li>
			<li>The &lt;body&gt; element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as 			headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</li>
			<li>The &lt;h1&gt; element defines a large heading</li>
			<li>The &lt;p&gt; element defines a paragraph</li>
		</ul>
